# Project Name: City Explorer

**Author**: Jacob Bassett
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview

This is an app that users can search for location based directions, amenities, weather, and other pertinent information.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? --> 
I will update this when I am closer to finishing the build.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
I will update this when I am closer to finishing the build.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
I will update this before the end of today.
